This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU Affero General Public License for more details.

FOSS License Exception
====================
What is the FOSS License Exception?

This Free and Open Source Software ("FOSS") License Exception allows developers of FOSS applications to include RavenDB with their FOSS applications. RavenDB is typically licensed pursuant to version 3 of the Affero General Public License ("AGPL"), but this exception permits distribution of RavenDB with a developer's FOSS applications licensed under the terms of another FOSS license listed below, even though such other FOSS license may be incompatible with the AGPL.
The following terms and conditions describe the circumstances under which this FOSS License Exception applies.

FOSS License Exception Terms and Conditions

Definitions:
	* "Derivative Work" means a derivative work, as defined under applicable copyright law, formed entirely from the Program and one or more FOSS Applications.
	* "FOSS Application" means a free and open source software application distributed subject to a license approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) board. A list of applicable licenses appears at: http://www.opensource.org/licenses/category.
	* "FOSS Notice" means a notice placed by Hibernating Rhinos or the RavenDB author in a copy of the RavenDB library stating that such copy of the RavenDB library may be distributed under Hibernating Rhinos's or RavenDB's FOSS License Exception.
	* "Independent Work" means portions of the Derivative Work that are not derived from the Program and can reasonably be considered independent and separate works.
	* "Program" means a copy of Hibernating Rhinos's RavenDB library that contains a FOSS Notice.

A FOSS application developer ("you" or "your") may distribute a Derivative Work provided that you and the Derivative Work meet all of the following conditions:

	* You obey the AGPL in all respects for the Program and all portions (including modifications) of the Program included in the Derivative Work (provided that this condition does not apply to Independent Works);
	* The Derivative Work does not include any work licensed under the AGPL other than the Program;
	* You distribute Independent Works subject to a license approved by the OSI which is listed in http://www.opensource.org/licenses/category;
	* You distribute Independent Works in object code or executable form with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code on the same medium and under the same FOSS license applying to the object code or executable forms;
	* All works that are aggregated with the Program or the Derivative Work on a medium or volume of storage are not derivative works of the Program, Derivative Work or FOSS Application, and must reasonably be considered independent and separate works.
	
Hibernating Rhinos reserves all rights not expressly granted in these terms and conditions. 
If all of the above conditions are not met, then this FOSS License Exception does not apply to you or your Derivative Work.

In addition to this license, RavenDB is offered under a commerical license. You can learn more about this option by contacting us using: http://hibernatingrhinos.com/contact
